A racing game built to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## About the Project

This is a thrilling racing game where players must navigate their car while facing incoming enemies. The game features three distinct types of enemies, each presenting a unique challenge:

To aid the player, various power-up items can be collected on the track, including:

*   **Fuel:** Replenishes your vehicle's energy.
*   **Health:** Restores your car's durability.
*   **Shield:** Provides temporary invulnerability.
